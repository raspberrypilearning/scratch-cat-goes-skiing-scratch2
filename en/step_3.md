## Controlling the skier

You will use the left and right arrow keys to control the skier sprite, making it go left and right across the slope.

First, make the skier move and point to the left. Your code needs to:

1. Start `when the left arrow key is pressed`{:class="blockevents"}
1. Change the angle the sprite is `pointed`{:class="blockmotion"}
1. Move the sprite to the left by `changing x`{:class="blockmotion"}

```blocks
when [left arrow v] key pressed
point in direction (105 v)
change x by (-10)
```

Use blocks similar to the ones above to make the sprite move to the right `when the right arrow key is pressed`{:class="blockevents"}.

Add blocks to your code so `when the right arrow key is pressed`{:class="blockevents"}, the sprite `points in the direction 75 degrees`{:class="blockmotion"} before `changing the x position by 10`{:class="blockmotion"}

--- hint ---

You will need these blocks:

```blocks
    
point in direction (75 v)

when [right arrow v] key pressed

change x by (10)
```

--- /hint ---

--- hint ---

Your code should look like this:

```blocks
when [right arrow v] key pressed
point in direction (75 v)
change x by (10)
```
